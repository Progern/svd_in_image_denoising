# Singular Value Decomposition in Image Noise Filtering

## General information

*Images* - source images used in research and evaluation.

Each IPython notebook represents an independent research about efficiency of separate denoising method.

## How to reproduce



### Google Colab

- Clone the repository
- Load the repository into Google Drive
- Open the required Google Colab IPython notebook
- Mount your drive and upload the required files ("Chooise files" button)
- If you want to use different images you would need to change the filenames in the notebook
- Run the code blocks one-by-one and have fun

### Local machine
- Clone the repository
- Open the Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter lab in the project folder
- You could omit the logic of mounting Google Drive (used only for Colab) 
- You need to change the filenames to the ones that would be in *../Images* in your system
- Run the code blocks one-by-one and have fun

**To review the results of our experiment open “K-SVD Results” file on “Algorithms evaluation” tab. There you can find results for every metric and image we processed with all algorithms.**
